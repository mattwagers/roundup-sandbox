# Contributing to The Consortium Blog

Thank you for contributing! Follow the steps below to create and submit a new post.

## 1. Branch naming

Create a new branch for each post using the convention:

```
post/short-description
```

Example: `post/power-analysis-tutorial`

## 2. Post folder naming

Inside `posts/`, create a folder named with the format:

```
YYYY-MM-short-title/
```

Example: `posts/2026-05-power-analysis/`

## 3. Files per post

| File | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `index.qmd` | Yes | Main post content |
| `references.bib` | Recommended | BibTeX references |
| `thumbnail.png` | Optional | Listing page preview image |
| `data/` | Optional | Any raw or processed data files |

## 4. Front matter template

Paste this at the top of your `index.qmd` and fill in the fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
author: "Your Name"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
categories: [category1, category2]
description: "A one- or two-sentence summary shown in the listing."
bibliography: references.bib
image: thumbnail.png
---
```

## 5. Local preview

To preview the blog locally before opening a PR:

```bash
quarto preview
```

This starts a live-reloading server at `http://localhost:4200`.

## 6. Git workflow

```bash
# Stage your new post folder
git add posts/YYYY-MM-short-title/

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add post: your post title"

# Push your branch
git push origin post/short-description
```

Then open a pull request on GitHub. Netlify will automatically post a 
deploy-preview link in the PR comments so reviewers can see a live preview 
before merging.

## 7. Style notes

- **Code folding:** All code chunks are folded by default (`code-fold: true`). 
  You can override this per-chunk with `#| code-fold: false` if a snippet is 
  central to the narrative.
- **Figure labels:** Label figures with `#| label: fig-something` and include 
  a `#| fig-cap:` for cross-referencing with `@fig-something`.
- **Bibliography:** Keep `.bib` files inside the post folder, not at the 
  project root, to avoid namespace collisions.
